        <h2>Blockchain: The Future of Voting</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Blockchain technology is the protocol behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This technology works by cryptographically compiling “blocks” on an ever-growing list of timestamped transactions. This list, or “public ledger,”
            cannot be compromised; the decentralized network of computers and servers must first validate any changes for a transaction to be hashed in a block. No centralized authority (e.g., President of the United States or Postmaster General) could
            subvert this system, so long as the system is truly decentralized. Users of the network can see for themselves any changes made to the ledger, so they can rest assured that their actions on the blockchain (i.e., their vote) has been
            recorded. The need for human or machine ballot counters and sorters would disintegrate as transactions on the blockchain occur in real time. This could also drive down the cost to operate elections via physical polling locations, hiring
            poll workers, and purchasing voting machines. Injecting trust into American Democracy can, and will, go a long way toward reducing stress, increasing faith in our elections, and breaking down partisan barriers between both representatives
            and citizens alike.
          </p>
          <p>It’s essential for the public to have faith in the outcome of our Democratic and free elections. Without this trust, American Democracy will cease to exist and people will become more polarized. Political discussions at the dinner table
            will be impossible to endure. Without lively and respectful political debates, it is difficult to envision positive change from happening at the scale needed to combat the major issues of our time. These issues include the economic fallout
            from COVID-19, adapting to life after the pandemic, and addressing the rapidly changing business landscape. Trailblazing municipalities should be the first to test blockchain voting systems. Holding side-by-side elections (in-person & on
            the blockchain) could serve as a “proof of concept” for this innovative technology before completely transitioning online. This would show people how the new system functions, instilling trust and understanding that all votes have been
            securely recorded.</p>
          <p>To increase citizen participation, a group of scientists, businesses and non-profits created a virtual municipality that would be able to move fast and innovate without any of the traditional hurdles. Vaardam is the first virtual
            municipality in the Netherlands. They are exploiting a range of Oracle technologies to encourage citizen participation in government decision-making that is transparent, resistant to fraud and easy to use – and can be applied to many other
            business use cases. A formal structure for decision-making was required – and they deployed a digital identity and voting application using blockchain technology on the Oracle platform to facilitate this.</p>
